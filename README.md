# ListTrackr

ListTrackr is a place to create lists to help you in life. From a list of stuff you need to get at the store, to a list of things to pack on vacation, creating lists can help us stay organized and keep track of certain things in life so we don't have to try and remember them all on our own. 

With ListTrackr you are able to create new lists with a title, add items/things to your list, edit and delete list items,and "complete" items on your list after they are no longer needed. You can click on a list item to complete it and it will darken and be crossed out with a line through it. You can also delete you list once you are officially done with it if you'd like!
